For this project we had to refactor a codebase to make sure the source code met basic accessibilty standards, had basic semantic elements and structure and followed a logical structure. Comments were added to make sure specfic sections of the codebase were easily located. Multiple classes with the same CSS attributes were consolidated into one to make the codebase smaller, cleaned and comprehensible. A logo was added to the address bar and also a title was added to the page. Original codebase had no alt text for the images so I provided alt text for all the images
